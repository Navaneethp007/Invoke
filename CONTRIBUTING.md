1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a new folder with your github handle as its name (eg. technodumb/)
3. To this folder, upload your HTML/CSS files that displays any shape (squares, rectangles, or anything else).
4. The name of the file should be the shape name.
5. If you are feeling creative, make complex looking structures in CSS. And give the file any name you want.
