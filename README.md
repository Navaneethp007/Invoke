<h2> Welcome Aboard, fellow creatives. </h2>

INVOKE is a special project where i collect different shapes and structures created in HTML using CSS. 

All shapes matter. Colorful shapes matter more. 

<h2> Instructions </h2>

Follow the below instructions carefully.
1. Fork this repo. (for instructions, check CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Create any shape using HTML/CSS and upload it in the respective directory.
3. If you are feeling creative, make complex looking structures in CSS. And upload them in the Random folder.
4. The name of the file should be in the format <i>\<github-handle>\_\<shape_name>.html</i>. (for eg: technodumb_square.html)

5. If the CSS file is external, give it the same name. (for eg: technodumb_square.css) and make sure to link it to the html properly.
6. Finally, open a PR and I would gladly accept all valid submissions.
